# Data-Types
<p>This is a repository on how data types are defined.</p><br>
<p>Data types specify the type of data stored in a variable.</p>
<p>Data types are grouped into two:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Primitive Data Types**-A primitive data type is a basic data type that's not built out of other data types i.e it si available in most of the programming languages. It can only represent one single value.Include:<br>
<ul>
<li>**String**-This is used to represent group of characters.
Eg: "Car" "Boat"</li>
<li>**Character**-This is used to represent single character e.g ‘C’, ‘a’</li>
<li>**Boolean**-This is used represent logical values either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.
 </li>
<li>**Interger**-represents a number without a decimal e.g 20,33</li>
<li>**Double and Float**-This is used to represent a number with decimal point e.g 32.1, 67.3</li>
<ul>
<li>**Non-primitve Data Types**-These are data types that are derived from primary data types and are used to store a group of values.Include:Arrays,Structure,Union etc.</li>
</ol>
