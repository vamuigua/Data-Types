<strong><h3>Abstract Data Types(ADTs)</h3></strong>
<p>These are mathematical models of a set of data values or information that share similar behavior or qualities and that can be specified and identified independent of specific implementations.</p>
<p>An abstract data type is defined in terms of its data items or its associated operations rather than by its implementation.</p>
